# ops-workflow

Non-code work — research, strategy, content, compliance — tends to scatter across Google Docs, emails, Notion pages, and your head. This [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin gives you a structured system to manage all of it from the terminal, with the same AI-powered workflow you already use for code.

For solo founders, indie hackers, and small teams who use Claude Code for development and want the same workflow for everything else.

## Quick Example

You're launching an AI tutoring startup. The code is handled, but you also need to research competitors, write grant applications, draft marketing copy, and track legal compliance.

**Set up a project:**

```
> /ops-scaffold
```

Claude asks a few questions about your project, then creates a structured repo with folders for state, backlog, references, artifacts, and plans.

**Do some work:**

```
> /ops:handle research competitor pricing for AI tutoring tools
```

Claude plans the research, you approve, and it executes — searching the web, writing up findings in `references/`, updating `state/` with the competitive landscape, and adding opportunities to the `backlog/`.

**Step away and let Claude work through the backlog:**

```
> /ops:get-to-work
```

Claude autonomously finds work — scanning existing goals for gaps and looking outward for new opportunities — then prioritizes, executes, and commits after each task. When you return, it walks you through what it decided and what needs your input.

**See where things stand:**

```
> /ops:overview
```

A synthesized executive summary — what's been done, what's in progress, and a prioritized list of what to do next.

**Bring in outside information:**

```
> /ops:update we got accepted into the TechStars AI cohort, program starts April 15
```

Claude classifies the information, updates the relevant state and backlog files, and adjusts priorities accordingly. You can also drop files (PDFs, notes, screenshots) into the `.update/` folder and run `/ops:update` — Claude will process everything in the inbox.

**Keep the knowledge base clean:**

```
> /ops:housekeeping
```

Runs 9 consistency checks — stale dates, orphaned files, INDEX.md accuracy, WAITING markers — auto-fixes what it can, flags the rest.

## All Commands

### Interactive

| Command             | What It Does                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ops:handle`       | End-to-end workflow: plan → approve → execute. Use for all non-trivial work. |
| `/ops:overview`     | Executive summary with prioritized "what to do next".                        |
| `/ops:update`       | Ingest external information into the knowledge base.                         |
| `/ops:housekeeping` | Run consistency checks on the knowledge structure. Auto-fixes what it can.   |
| `/ops-scaffold`     | Set up a new ops repo from scratch.                                          |

### Autonomous

| Command              | What It Does                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ops:get-to-work`   | Fully autonomous loop: find work → prioritize → execute → repeat. Step away and come back to a follow-up review. |
| `/ops:batch-plan`    | Write multiple plans in parallel without interruption.                                                           |
| `/ops:batch-execute` | Execute multiple approved plans sequentially without interruption.                                               |
| `/review-followup`   | Walk through decisions Claude made during autonomous runs.                                                       |

### Discovery

| Command           | What It Does                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ops-find-tasks` | Scan the project through 7 lenses to surface new backlog items.  |
| `/ops-find-opps`  | Look beyond existing plans for new directions and opportunities. |

## Safety

All autonomous commands enforce these rules:

- **No real-world actions** — never sends emails, submits forms, posts to social media, or calls external APIs
- **No file deletion** — intended deletions are recorded for your review
- **No remote push** — only local branches and commits
- **Transparent decisions** — when uncertain, records its reasoning for you to review

### Architecture

Commands (listed above) are orchestrators built from composable skills (`/ops-plan`, `/ops-execute`, `/ops-prioritize`, etc.). Autonomous commands delegate to **agents** — isolated sub-processes that run a skill, write outputs to files, and return only a concise summary to keep the orchestrator's context clean.

### The get-to-work Loop

```
[Cycle 1]
  ops-task-finder agent → scan 7 lenses → add backlog items
      ↓ (escalate if low yield)
  ops-opps-finder agent → find new directions → add backlog items
      ↓
  ops-prioritize → select 2-3 independent, feasible tasks
      ↓
  ops-executor agents → execute each task, update state, commit
      ↓
[Cycle 2, 3, ...] until stopping conditions met
      ↓
  /review-followup → walk through decisions with user
```

### Permissions and Autonomous Execution

The autonomous commands (`/ops:get-to-work`, `/ops:batch-execute`) run for extended periods without user intervention. For this to work smoothly, Claude Code needs pre-approved permissions for the tools these agents use.

**If the process keeps pausing for permission prompts, it's not truly autonomous.** Configure your `settings.json` (globally at `~/.claude/settings.json` or per-project at `.claude/settings.json`) with `allow` lists covering:

- File operations: `Bash(ls *)`, `Bash(mv *)`, `Bash(rm ".tmp/*")`
- Git commands: `Bash(git add *)`, `Bash(git status *)`, `Bash(git log *)`, `Bash(git diff *)`, `Bash(git branch *)`, `Bash(git commit *)`
- Web access: `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`
- Skill invocation: `Skill(ops-execute)`, etc.

See Claude Code's [permissions documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/security) for details.

### Contributing to the Plugin

Claude Code installs plugins as shallow clones (single commit, no full history). To edit the plugin source and push changes back, fetch the full history:

```bash
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ops-workflow fetch --unshallow
```

Plugin updates via Claude Code (`/plugin update`) may re-shallow the clone — run `fetch --unshallow` again afterward if you need the full history.
